Daniel Lamb  2:12 PM
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv  GitHub data from the NyTimes. It has data from the first recorded case in January to the 26th of July, it is constantly updated. (edited)

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  2:21 PM
@Daniel Lamb that's a well curated source of data.

Daniel Lamb  2:33 PM
So what did you guys want to do with whatever we decided. Were we trying to compare it to something on the graph or what... Im kinda stuck on how and what I should be doing in plotly and how I should go about this. (edited)
2:34
Thank you, the summer program that I was in introduced me to it because we had to do a project with those data sets

Colton Grainger  2:34 PM
can you reproduce an example from https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/

Kellen Hill  2:35 PM
I'm walking through the plotly dash tutorial here: https://dash.plotly.com/installation
dash.plotly.comdash.plotly.com
Part 1. Installation | Dash for Python Documentation | Plotly
How to install and upgrade dash libraries with pip

Daniel Lamb  2:36 PM
so for right now i'm just trying to get the data on to a plotly graph

Colton Grainger  2:46 PM
yeah, for example, you could fork https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps and try to get these running on your own machine

2:47
once you're able to run one of the demo dash apps, try making your own (probably just a basic histogram or something similar) from a COVID-19 csv dataset that you've pulled from the web

Daniel Lamb  2:50 PM
Ok thanks!

Colton Grainger  2:52 PM
this app is particularly interesting, since it's live updating https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-wind-streaming

Colton Grainger  3:00 PM
Kellen / Daniel, were y'all able to run one of the dash-sample-apps from https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps on your own machine?

Kellen Hill  3:01 PM
I'm running into an error with not having pandas installed so I'm working through that

Daniel Lamb  3:01 PM
i didnt get to try it with any data that i found or anything i was watching a tutorial but i can try real quick

Colton Grainger  3:02 PM
@Kellen Hill Try How to run this app
(The following instructions apply to Posix/bash. Windows users should check here.)
First, clone this repository and open a terminal inside the root folder.
Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended) by running the following:
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:
python app.py

Daniel Lamb  3:03 PM
do we need this for the presentation in a hour

Colton Grainger  3:03 PM
from https://github.com/coltongrainger/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-wind-streaming

Kellen Hill  3:04 PM
I was still working on the tutorial link I had posted, but I can give that a shot

Colton Grainger  3:04 PM
@Daniel Lamb no, for the presentation we just need to get our names on a PDF page, and some goals. I'm happy to put that together in like 40 minutes if you want more time to explore
:+1:

Kellen Hill  3:04 PM
Regardless of where we are with learning plotly, we should get to work on the presentation so we're not rushing just before 6

Colton Grainger  3:04 PM
@Kellen Hill I think using a venv would get you around installing pandas

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:05 PM
Something to think about is that this is the challenge of using plotly
3:05
perhaps your goal could be how to get past these rough edges

Colton Grainger  3:05 PM
hmm (edited)

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:05 PM
some of our data scientists can't get past just the "hello world" of plotly (even though they can do other brilliant things)

Colton Grainger  3:08 PM
@Kellen Hill @Daniel Lamb Can we videocall in, say, 30 minutes? It shouldn't take long to type out our goals and names and team name; I can do this when we meet and send it to Je'aime.

Kellen Hill  3:08 PM
Thumbs up

Daniel Lamb  3:08 PM
cool

Colton Grainger  3:13 PM
back to the dash-wind-streaming example, this is the type of Python source code we might fork and develop for our own purposes... https://github.com/coltongrainger/dash-sample-apps/blob/master/apps/dash-wind-streaming/app.py

also, other challenges with dash are that simply running it on your computer is not equivalent to putting it on the web

@Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor), do you have the source code for https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/dash/hello_world/

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:26 PM
it's private i can send you some parts though
3:26
what specifically do you need?

Colton Grainger  3:26 PM
how about the app.py file?

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:26 PM
it's all in the app.py!

Colton Grainger  3:26 PM
ekk
3:26
sorry
3:27
could you tell us about the deploy process for those dash apps in particular?

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:27 PM
certainly

Colton Grainger  3:27 PM
ty

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  3:27 PM
there's a wrapper flask app that i have setup to serve multiple dashes
3:28
oh wait you're just asking for hello world lol
3:29
let me sanitize this and put it up

Colton Grainger  3:29 PM
well, yeah, the hello_world_app.py would be instructive, but also knowing how the wrapper flask app is setup could be useful for a scientist wanting to "create their own dashboard gallery"
3:29

Colton Grainger  3:36 PM
@Kellen Hill @Daniel Lamb ready to call in 5 minutes?

Daniel Lamb  3:36 PM

hey @Daniel Lamb @Kellen Hill we can chat on here further during this meeting
4:09
what sort of intermediate goals do you think we should try to tackle tonight?

Kellen Hill  4:09 PM
Gaining basic familiarity with the tools being used
4:10
Narrowing down the data sets we are interested in pursuing

Daniel Lamb  4:10 PM
yea learning how plotly works
Added to your saved items

Colton Grainger  4:11 PM
we could work together on staying online via slack
4:11
as in, work through the tutorial together to get through whatever git/python issues come up
4:13
a second goal might be to look at Joon Yee's https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/dash/ (gallery) and https://github.com/jchuahtacc/CloudHPCHackVizPiplineTeamA/tree/master/dash_rolodex_public (which is the backend for the gallery)

Colton Grainger  4:26 PM
Do you want to ?

Daniel Lamb  4:26 PM
nooo

Colton Grainger  4:26 PM

Colton Grainger  6:11 PM
yo yo! we're talking with Joon in 1 hour. Dinner took longer than I was expecting. Would the two of you want to start peer-programming?

Kellen Hill  6:11 PM
I could use another set of eyes

Daniel Lamb  6:12 PM

I think so. @Colton Grainger was able to get me to a point with the tutorial to run it. We are super close for @Daniel Lamb

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  6:59 PM
oh, ok. would you rather me check in with y'all later? i don't want to interrupt

I think this is the COVID data set I think would be best to work with since it includes all states and is updated regularly. At this point in time, we would mainly focus on three columns (date, state, and death). Any thoughts or concerns?

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  10:58 AM
i recommend allowing the user to specify a metadata.json to describe their data
10:58
rather than having to modify python code.

Colton Grainger  10:58 AM
kk

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  10:58 AM
that way you can write the python to just process something like:
{
 "states": "mystatefield",
10:58
"timestamp": "mytimestampfield",
"value": "myvaluefield"
}

ok, what do you have in terms of the 3 step process?

Daniel Lamb  11:06 AM

make a on-demand environment for plotly dash

Colton Grainger  11:07 AM
"Make a template that users can easily input their data and label properties" belongs to Kellen I think, so step 1
11:07
could step 3 focus on parsing the well formatted dataset?
11:08
parsing and generating a plotly graphic?
11:08
Kellen, could you say more about the fields that you believe should be included in step 1?
11:09
otherwise, Daniel, that sounds good

Daniel Lamb  11:09 AM
yall want to make a slide?
11:09
google slidde

Kellen Hill  11:09 AM
Yeah, I can elaborate on those fields
11:09
Sounds like we'll get another 15 minutes to work on it

Colton Grainger  11:09 AM
can you whip up a google slide Kellen?

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  11:10 AM
if you want the $$$ remember to summarize and sell
11:10
show your objectives

these are command line examples to get the example plotly dash choropleth maps running

Kellen Hill  6:34 PM
I'm going to try exporting a csv using pandas and then I'll look into that
6:36
Any thoughts on where I should be exporting a csv to? I guess that could differ from user to user and would need to be specified by a user when they are setting up to program for their purposes

Colton Grainger  6:42 PM
sorry
6:43
create a directory in the git repo, on your own branch.
6:43
write the scripts in that directory
6:43
export the CSV files to that directory
6:43
seriously
6:43
do not let the user decide
6:44
it doesn't work that way: usually they make bad choices if they don't know what's going on, and if they do know what's going on, they can modify our code to bend it to their will.
6:48
@Kellen Hill how's it going? do you need any support interacting with the file system in python (edited)
6:48
?

Kellen Hill  6:49 PM
I'm working on chopping out all of the unused fields in my csv. A bit tedious when there are so many of them. I think I'm making good progress for cutting it down to the main fields and exporting a csv

Colton Grainger  6:50 PM
drop_these = ['column_name1', 'column_name2', 'last_columns']
df = df.drop(columns=drop_these)

Joon Yee Chuah (Mentor)  6:52 PM
It may be easier to construct a data frame with fields you want rather than the other way around.

Kellen Hill  6:53 PM
So I created a data frame with the ones I wanted, but I didn (edited)
6:54
't see how to output that as a csv, but I figured out how to chop them from the frame and then output that

Colton Grainger  6:55 PM
df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['Raphael', 'Donatello'],
                   'mask': ['red', 'purple'],
                   'weapon': ['sai', 'bo staff']})
df.to_csv(index=False)
output
'name,mask,weapon\nRaphael,red,sai\nDonatello,purple,bo staff\n'

Kellen Hill  6:56 PM
It worked!
6:57
How do I get rid of a field with a null field name though?
6:57

6:57
Is it just ""

Colton Grainger  6:58 PM
with open('target.csv', 'w') as f:
    f.write(df.to_csv(index=False))
6:58
?
6:58
index=False?
6:59
or
df.to_csv('target.csv', index=False)
6:59
?

Kellen Hill  6:59 PM
So index=False should recognize a null value header?

Daniel Lamb  7:00 PM
are yall getting on the zoom call with the other team or are we just going to continue working

What should my target.csv be? Should that be the initial csv that's pulled in? Or the modified on that I'm saving?

Colton Grainger  7:06 PM
ok, try a relative path. also, what directory is your PyCharm project in?

Kellen Hill  7:06 PM
I have not pushed it up yet

Colton Grainger  7:06 PM
I mean to say, would it be so evil to work in the git repo with PyCharm?
7:07
But regardless, a relative path is just the name of the file relative to the directory the python interpreter is running in

Kellen Hill  7:07 PM
C:\Users\USER\PycharmProjects\Coviddata\InputData.py (edited)

Colton Grainger  7:09 PM
ok, so
df.to_csv(r'C:\Users\USER\PycharmProjects\Coviddata\here.csv', index=False)
is equivalent to
df.to_csv('here.csv', index=False)
if you're running PyCharm's python interpreter in the directory
C:\Users\USER\PycharmProjects\Coviddata

do you want to just screen share for a second?

Kellen Hill  7:09 PM
Yeah

Kellen Hill  8:38 PM
@Daniel Lamb grab a screenshot of the map if you can to post it in here

Kellen Hill  8:41 PM
Also, @Colton Grainger we discussed doing a check in at 11am EST tomorrow morning on the other call

Colton Grainger  8:42 PM
boom done
8:42
daniel that looks most dope

Kellen Hill  8:45 PM
We'll most likely end up swapping to the data set Daniel is working off of since we just built the plotly around it a bit

Colton Grainger  8:46 PM
sounds good to me; you're driving here
8:46
*there

Kellen Hill  8:46 PM
Yeah, it shouldn't be difficult to make that swap with where I'm at

Colton Grainger  8:46 PM
do y'all think you could post a 'minimal working example' to the github tonight?

Kellen Hill  8:47 PM
I guess @Daniel Lamb would just need to get his code pushed for that to happen
