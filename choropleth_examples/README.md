## Learn you the command line for great good

0. Do you have `git`? Can you clone this repo? 

```
git clone https://github.com/jchuahtacc/CloudHPCHackVizPiplineTeamA/tree/master/choropleth_examples
```

1. Navigate (with the command line) to the same directory as the README.md. 

```
cd CloudHPCHackVizPiplineTeamA/choropleth_examples
```

2. **Am I in the correct directory?** (The command is `ls` for a unix-like / `dir` for windows.) 

*command line input*

```
ls
```

*desired output*

```
app00.py  app01.py  app02.py  app03.py	README.md
```

3. Try this *command line input*: `python3 app00.py`. No output? Look at <https://127.0.0.1:8050>.

4. Something's wrong? Have you installed the **required packages** with `pip3`? 

> Never `pip3` with `sudo`! The install command `pip3 install --user` is my preference, and probably the wrong way to do things, but fine for a hackathon. 


## Required Packages

`geopandas`, `pyshp` and `shapely` must be installed for this figure factory.

Run the following commands to install the correct versions of the following modules:

```sh
pip3 install --user geopandas==0.3.0
pip3 install --user pyshp==1.2.10
pip3 install --user shapely==1.6.3
```

Opps! Don't forget to install Dash.

```sh
pip3 install --user dash==1.14.0
```

## Talk to you peers about this section!

These coropleth map examples exhibit a legacy "figure factory" method for creating map-like figures using self-filled scatter traces. 

The (depreciated) documentation for the function `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is here: 

<https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth.html>

**Beachtung!** This is no longer the recommended way to make county-level choropleth maps, instead we recommend using a GeoJSON-based approach to making outline choropleth maps or the alternative Mapbox tile-based choropleth maps.

Everywhere in this apps that you see `fig.show()`, **you can display the same figure in a Dash application** by passing it to the figure argument of the `Graph` component from the built-in `dash_core_components` package like this:

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = go.Figure() # or any Plotly Express function e.g. px.bar(...)
# fig.add_trace( ... )
# fig.update_layout( ... )

import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash()
app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Graph(figure=fig)
])

app.run_server(debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```
